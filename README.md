# Assistant Concept - Planning Work

This is a collection of scratch work and pieces to be used in the assistant product concept. This is basically a static mockup at this point built with react.

## Installation
After cloning the repo you will need to build the js and css bundles before the plugin will display. You can do that by:

```
cd /to/your/repo/folder
npm install
npm run build
```
If that looks foreign, ask Brent or Justin about it.
