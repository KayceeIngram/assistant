# Assistant - Work In Progress

[![Master Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beaverbuilder/assistant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beaverbuilder/assistant)

A tool for seeing what's happening inside WordPress and quickly navigating between pages & posts.

## Installation
After cloning the repo you will need to build the js and css bundles before the plugin will display. You can do that by:

```
cd /to/your/repo/folder
npm install
npm run build
```
If that looks foreign, ask Brent or Justin about it.

## Development
Use the following npm commands after cloning the repo to work on the project.

Build development files and watch for changes...
```
npm run dev
```

Run unit tests and linters...
```
npm run test
```

Attempt to fix errors caught by linters...
```
npm run fix
```
