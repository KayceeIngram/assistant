== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Assistant require Beaver Builder to work?

No, Assistant is a standalone plugin and can be used with any WordPress installation on its own.

= Does Assistant provide a public API for developers to create new apps?

While we do not currently offer a developer API, that is on our roadmap for the 1.0 release. We'll be sharing more details about that as we get closer to that milestone.
